#### What is it?

Most npm parser libraries out there are single purpose parsers that provide conversion capabilites from only one target data serialization language into JSON. J-parser is a wrapper around some of the most widely used npm parser libraries out there: `js-yaml`, `fast-xml-parser`, and `table-to-json` and exposes a simple API 

#### Target Features
