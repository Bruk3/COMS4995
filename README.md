Open Source Development

Ideas

- Still brainstorming ideas for the project but I want to work on some sort of open source npm library
1. `js-universal-parser`
  - Most npm parsers out there are only single purpose parsers such as:
    - `js-yaml`: parses yaml files into a json object and also dumps json objects into a yaml file
    - `fast-xml-parser`: parses xml files into a json object and dumps json objects into an xml file
 `js-universal-parser` will be a wrapper around these libraries that exposes an api that allows a seemless conversion of one format to another
